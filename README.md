Aleph
=====
> “The Aleph?” I repeated.
”Yes, the only place on earth where all places are — seen from every angle, each standing clear, without any confusion or blending.”

Aleph is a privileged point of observation on Light Table's inner machinery: a browser for the BOT architecture.

## Installation
Aleph is available through the plugin manager.

Alternatively, you can manually clone this repository and place it into your plugin folder.  

## Usage
Only one command is included in the current prerelease:
#### `Aleph: show browser`
The Aleph browser exposes a simple index of the current BOT state.

Each of behaviors, objects, and tags have their own fuzzy-searchable list—akin to the command bar or navigator.  
When you query any of these lists, Aleph will update the others to display entries associated to your search results.

To drop an ongoing query and reset the list view, just clear all input fields.
